 *
 * This function abstracts the interaction with the `AccountService`, providing
 * a clean API for other parts of the system to retrieve an account by the
 * owner's user ID. By leveraging `ReaderTaskEither`, it not only handles
 * asynchronous operations but also allows dependency injection for the service
 * without explicitly passing it around every time.
 *
 * The use of `ReaderTaskEither` integrates three monads:
 * - `Reader`: Injects the `AccountService` dependency.
 * - `Task`: Handles the asynchronous execution.
 * - `Either`: Manages success and failure cases, returning either a
 * `UserServiceError` or an `Option<Account>`.
 *
 * This composition ensures that side effects and dependencies are handled
 * functionally and composably. Additionally, this approach allows for
 * automatic type widening when additional dependencies are introduced,
 * meaning that the function remains flexible and can be easily composed with
 * other services.
 *
 * By using this pattern, we adhere to the Onion architecture principle of
 * keeping core domain logic decoupled from the service implementation, as well
 * as the Dependency Inversion Principle by relying on abstractions rather than
 * concrete implementations.
 *
 * @param ownerId - The ID of the user who owns the account.
 * @returns A `ReaderTaskEither` that resolves with either an
 * `AccountServiceError` or an `Option<Account>`. The `Reader` component
 * ensures that the `AccountService` is passed implicitly, allowing for easy
 * composition with other dependencies.
